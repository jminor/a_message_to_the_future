A message to future people reading from the GitHub Arctic Code Vault - https://archiveprogram.github.com/

I hope we did the right thing. I hope our wisdom, compassion, and perseverance have carried us through the many challenges that lie between now, when I write this, and the future, when you are reading this. May you have peace, prosperity, and joy.
